# Word Reverse

This project is part of a technical assessment.
The function reverses letters within a string, while leaving words in their original order.
The function accepts lowercase letters and spaces only.
For example, when passed the input string "british broadcasting corporation", the output string is "hsitirb gnitsacdaorb noitaroproc"
